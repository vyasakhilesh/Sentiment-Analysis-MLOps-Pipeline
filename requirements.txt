# requirements.txt
# If you prefer not to maintain multiple requirements files, you can include test dependencies in the existing requirements.txt. However, this approach is less flexible and may lead to a bloated production environment.

# Pros: Simpler file structure with fewer requirements files, Easier to manage in smaller projects.
# Cons: Production environment may include unnecessary packages., Harder to distinguish between production and development dependencies.
