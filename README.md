# Sentiment Analysis MLOps Pipeline
## An overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines

Creating a well-organized directory structure is crucial for the maintainability, scalability, and collaboration of your project. Below is a recommended directory structure for the Real-Time Sentiment Analysis Service project, tailored for GitHub. This structure separates different components of the project, making it easier to navigate and manage.

## Explanation and Best Practices
Separation of Concerns:
app/, model/, and worker/ directories clearly separate the backend application, model training/serving, and worker services, respectively. This modularity enhances maintainability and scalability.

Dockerization:
docker/ directory contains separate Dockerfiles for each service, allowing independent containerization and deployment.
Using distinct Dockerfiles ensures that each service has only the dependencies it requires, optimizing image sizes and build times.

Kubernetes Configurations:
k8s/ directory holds all Kubernetes manifests, making it straightforward to deploy and manage services within the cluster.
Including deployment.yaml, service.yaml, hpa.yaml, and optionally ingress.yaml provides a complete setup for deploying, exposing, and scaling services.

CI/CD Pipeline:
.github/workflows/deploy.yml automates the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring that changes are consistently and reliably integrated into production.
Utilizing GitHub Actions promotes continuous integration and continuous deployment best practices.

Scripts Automation:
scripts/ directory contains shell scripts for setting up AWS resources, deploying Kubernetes configurations, and building/pushing Docker images. Automating these tasks reduces manual errors and speeds up the development process.

Testing:
tests/ directory includes unit tests for different components, ensuring code reliability and facilitating easier debugging.
Implementing tests early in the development lifecycle helps catch issues before they reach production.

Load Testing:
locust/ directory contains scripts for load testing the API endpoints, enabling performance evaluation under various traffic conditions.

Logging and Monitoring:
logs/ directory (primarily for development) and configs/ directory for monitoring configurations ensure that system behavior is observable and can be analyzed for troubleshooting and optimization.

Environment Configuration:
Sensitive information like database URLs and SQS queue URLs should be managed using Kubernetes Secrets or environment variables, avoiding hardcoding credentials in the codebase.

Documentation:
README.md provides essential information for users and contributors, including project setup, deployment instructions, and usage guidelines.
Clear documentation facilitates collaboration and onboarding of new team members.

Version Control Best Practices:
.gitignore prevents sensitive and unnecessary files from being tracked, maintaining a clean and secure repository.
Organizing code into logical directories and following naming conventions enhances readability and navigability.

## Final Notes
Environment Variables & Secrets:

Use environment variables to manage sensitive information. In Kubernetes, leverage Secrets to securely store credentials.
Version Control:

Regularly commit changes with clear and descriptive messages.
Use feature branches and pull requests to manage code changes and facilitate code reviews.
Documentation:

Continuously update the README.md with new instructions, API documentation, and usage examples.
Consider using tools like Swagger or Redoc to auto-generate API documentation from your FastAPI application.
Continuous Integration:

Ensure that the CI/CD pipeline includes steps for linting, testing, building, and deploying to maintain code quality and streamline deployments.
Scalability & Maintenance:

Regularly review and refactor code to improve performance and maintainability.
Monitor system performance and adjust resources as needed to handle increasing loads.
By following this directory structure and adhering to best practices, you set a solid foundation for your project, facilitating collaboration, scalability, and efficient development workflows.
